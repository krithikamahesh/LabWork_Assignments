> As a part of lab work for Algorithmic Machine Learning, this Kaggle challenge includes: data analysis, cleaning and pre-processing,
> development of a statistical model and it's validation.
> Five models implemented and compared are: Linear Regression, XGBoost, Bayesian Ridge Regression, LASSO Model, Random Forest.

> After an introduction to the stock market terminology, Monte Carlo simulation is described and implemented with a simple example.
> A real use case is then worked on after understanding the common distributions in MCS.
> Stock and factor datasets used are downloaded from Yahoo! and Investing.com

**Recommender System**

> After working on understanding the Matrix Factorization and Alternating Least Squares, a simple model for a music recommender system is developed.
> At first, the underlying dataset is analysed using Spark SQL. Inconsistencies are identified and data is cleaned.
> Collaborative-Filtering is then employed to build a statistical recommender system which is then evaluated using AUC as the metric.
